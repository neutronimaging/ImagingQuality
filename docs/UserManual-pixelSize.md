# Measure pixel size from known objekts
The pixel size varies with the current setup and must be measured from the images. Typically, this is done by measuring the distance between two points in with a known metric distance. 
The pixel size is then defined as <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mbox{Pixelsize}=\frac{\mbox{Metric distance}}{\mbox{Number of pixels}}" border="0"/>
