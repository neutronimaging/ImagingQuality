# Reporting bugs and requesting features
We do our best efforts to make the analysis software as good as possible but unfortunately, few software are perfect. If the program doesn't behave as you would expect, the ideal way to report bugs and feature requests is through the [issue submission system at GitHub](https://github.com/neutronimaging/ImagingQuality/issues).

## Open source 
The development is open source under the GNU3 public license and the sources can be downloaded from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neutronimaging/ImagingQuality).
